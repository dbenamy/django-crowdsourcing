Django-crowdsourcing is an MIT-licensed survey and report tool for journalists, supporting many types of survey questions and a wide variety of reporting options. A reusable Django application, it is designed to be installed easily in any Django site, including multi-site installations. Its surveys are entirely configured within the admin interface that ships with Django.

While the primary focus of development is support for crowdsourcing projects, the survey tool is general purpose and can be used for a variety of applications. It is easy enough to handle simple polls with pie charts, yet powerful enough to handle complicated surveys with rich multimedia responses plotted on a map with custom icons.
